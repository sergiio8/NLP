Fake news classification using NLP techniques. Implemented a comparative study of supervised classifiers using TF-IDF (achieving 99% accuracy with Decision Trees) and Deep Learning models using Word Embeddings. The Neural Network approach achieved an F1 score of 96% by leveraging different embedding strategies (frozen, unfrozen, and learned). Tools: Python, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras, NLTK.
